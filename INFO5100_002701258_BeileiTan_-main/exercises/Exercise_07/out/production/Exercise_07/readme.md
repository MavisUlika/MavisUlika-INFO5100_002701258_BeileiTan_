## Class Exercise 07 -- Generics

### Write 3 generic methods 

Please run the "Test" class to see the final outputs.

Question 1:
      Consists of 3 files and 4 steps.

* Step 1: Create an interface

  We can implement this interface in our customized classes way. Every special class (e.g. odd integers, prime numbers) that implments "SomeSpecialCollection" class, will  will be responsible for its own implementation of the match method.

* Step 2: Create implementation classes

  Write methods for functional implementations.

* Step 3: Create Algorithm class
  
   This class acts as an intermediary or facade class to perform the count based on the supplied class as parameter.

* Step 4: Create a Test class

  Provide example to confirm that program can run correctly and successfully.

  
Question 2 and Question 3: The methods have added in "Algorithm" class and tested in "Test" class.
